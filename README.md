Plex Channel project for TV Land website

Client and Region Restrictions: 
This channel may not work on newer Plex clients if they cannot handle full episode videos from channels in parts. If the multiple parts for a full episode do not load on your player, refer to your Plex clients support pages to make sure your client supports videos that are split into parts.  
Also this channel is region restricted to the United States, because you can only access the videos on this website from a United States IP address.
